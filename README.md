### Space Simulator
# Mechanics
Space simulator simulates gravity between bodies.
At the moment it is set up with the Sun, Earth and the Moon, with accurate distances, masses and sizes.
All bodies are spheres at the moment.
# Controls
WASD, with Left Shift and Space for down and up. Minecraft controls.
# Future plans
Improve space lighting.
Give planets noise so they have realistic terrain, approximate this from far away, but load in the planet when getting close.
